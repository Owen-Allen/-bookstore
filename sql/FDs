CHECK THIS WITH OWEN
for order_object:
order_id,isbn->quantity,order_id,isbn

because a user can order to different locations based on their order
(that is to say a user can order to someplace that is not their stored
location information), the user_id cannot imply this information.
user_order:
user_id,order_id->current_house_number,current_street,current_city,current_province,
current_postal_code,shipping_house_number,shipping_street,shipping_city,shipping_province,
shipping_postal_code,billing_house_number,billing_street,billing_city,billing_province,billing_postal_code,user_order,order_id

(there are no duplicate orders, so the order_id can point to the user_order, meaning technically the only primary key here is order_id, we should make this change?)
order_id->user_order

user_account:
user_id->name,shipping_house_number,shipping_street,shipping_city,shipping_province,shipping_postal_code,billing_house_number,billing_street,billing_city,billing_province,billing_postal_code,user_id


I think we need to show these FD's for the whole table, not just for individual
relations i.e show what just the user_id implies for the WHOLE table. We NEED to confirm with
